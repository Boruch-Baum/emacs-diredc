;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package extends and configures `dired' with features found in
;; almost all 'file managers', and also some unique features:
;;
;;   * Resilient dedicated dual-pane frame.
;;     * similar look to 'midnight commander'.
;;     * intelligent recovery of manually altered frame configuration
;;     * exit diredc/dired cleanly and totally
;;   * Navigable directory history
;;     * backward, forward, or to a direct history entry
;;   * File quick-preview mode
;;     * inspired by, and similar to, midnight commander's "C-x q"
;;     * customizable exclusion criteria to suppress undesirable files
;;       (eg. binaries)
;;   * Current file's supplemental information in minibuffer (optional)
;;     * eg. output from 'getfattr', 'getfacl', 'stat', 'exif'.
;;   * Multiple panel views
;;     * inspired by, and similar to, midnight commander's "M-t"
;;       * superior configurability
;;       * directly choose a specific panel view, or toggle to next
;;   * Extensive and easy-to-use sort options
;;     * including options not in 'ls': sort by chmod, owner, group
;;   * Swap panels (use "M-u")
;;     * inspired by, and similar to, midnight commander's "C-u"
;;       * a TRUE and complete swap (including history entries)
;;   * Trash management
;;     * per xfreedesktop standard
;;     * restore trashed files to their original locations
;;     * empty the trash, along with its administrative overhead
;;     * view trash summary information
;;   * Navigate 'up' n parent directories
;;   * Launch persistent asynchronous processes for files
;;     * Processes will survive even after exiting Emacs.
;;   * Quick shell window
;;     * choose your default shell / terminal emulation mode
;;     * choose your default shell program
;;     * easily opt for pre-configured alternatives
;;     * useful pre-defined shell variables
;;       * $d1, $d2  dired-directory in this/other pane
;;       * $f1, $f2  current dired file in this/other pane
;;       * $t1, $t2  tagged elements in this other pane
;;         * as a shell array variable, if supported by the shell
;;       * $INSIDE_DIREDC  value of variable 'diredc--version'
;;   * Bookmark support
;;   * Edit dired buffers (really `wdired-mode', not `diredc')
;;   * Set both panels to same directory (use "=" or "C-u =")
;;     * inspired by 'midnight commander's "M-i"
;;   * Fontify filenames based upon their names or extensions
;;     * fontify 'executable' suffix symbol
;;
;; Bonus customization features
;;   * Customize colors for chmod bits (font-lock)
;;   * toggle display of "hidden" or "undesirable" files (dired-omit mode)
;;   * auto-refresh buffers (auto-revert-mode)
;;   * highlight current line (hl-line-mode)
;;     * current buffer highlights with a unique face.
;;   * don't wrap long lines (toggle-truncate-lines)
;;   * to disable:
;;     * option 1: M-x customize-variable diredc-bonus-configuration
;;     * option 2: (setq diredc-bonus-configuration nil)

;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; 1) Evaluate or load this file.
;;
;; 2) I recommend defining a global keybinding for function `diredc',
;;    with a preference for Shift-F11, as follows:
;;
;;      (global-set-key (kbd "S-<f11>") 'diredc)
;;
;;    An alternative or additional option would be:
;;
;;      (global-set-key [remap dired-other-frame] 'diredc)


;;
;;; Operation:
;;
;; Running `diredc' an initial time creates and selects a frame named
;; `diredc' with two side-by-side `dired' windows / buffers. Repeating the
;; command will return you to your prior frame / window / buffer.
;; Subsequent use of the command continues to toggle back and forth to/from
;; the named `diredc' frame.
;;
;; In addition to the usual Emacs keybinding help, diredc provides two
;; combination keybinding cheat-sheets and command launchers, both using
;; optional dependency package `key-assist'. You can also interactively
;; call M-x `key-assist' <RET> <RET> to view an exhaustive `dired'
;; keybinding listing. A separate `key-assist' is provided for
;; trash-related functions because it also displays the current trash state
;; statistics.
;;
;;     h                        `diredc-key-assist'
;;     C-<delete> ?             `diredc-trash-key-assist'
;;     ?                        `diredc-summary'
;;     C-h m                    `describe-mode'
;;
;; Navigation from one `dired' panel to another can be accomplished using
;; '<TAB>' or 'S-<TAB>'. As long as you are in `diredc' mode, navigating to
;; new directories should not accumulate additional `dired' buffers and
;; your directory navigation history for each panel should be remembered.
;; If ever you find that the frame configuration has become botched, or you
;; somehow accumulate or have lost `dired' buffers, Run M-x
;; `diredc-recover'. You can also cleanly kill all `dired' buffers and the
;; `diredc' frame using `C-q' (M-x `diredc-quit'). And, if you want to use
;; `dired' without the `diredc' features, run M-x `diredc-mode' to toggle
;; the mode off.
;;
;; As mentioned above, each `dired' panel now 'remembers' its navigation
;; history. The history can be traversed sequentially backward 'C-<left>'
;; or forward 'C-<right>' without losing elements, and can be viewed and
;; traversed non-sequentially using 'C-u /'. Use '/' to directly navigate
;; to a directory not 'nearby'.
;;
;; A 'file preview' mode can be entered or exited using 'C-x q' (M-x
;; `diredc-browse-mode'). In that mode, whenever a `dired' buffer's POINT
;; is on a file's line, that file will be opened on the other pane, in
;; read-only emacs `view-mode' (see there for the navigation and other
;; features of that mode). The `view-mode' buffer is deleted automatically
;; when you either disable the mode or you move point to another line in
;; the `dired' buffer. Use '<TAB>' or 'S-<TAB>' to navigate between the
;; `dired' buffer window and the file preview window. There are several
;; options for excluding undesirable files (eg. binaries) from preview; see
;; the mode's docstring for details.
;;
;; The traditional `dired' operations that 'find' or 'open' a file should
;; do so to a separate frame, most likely the one from which you came to
;; the `diredc' frame.
;;
;; The traditional `dired' feature to perform arbitrary asynchronous
;; operations on a file or set of files has been enhanced to make those
;; processes persistent, to survive even after exiting Emacs. Thus, with
;; the default keybinding, you can press '&' <RET> and have the selected
;; file(s) launched in the system-default external application. Do be
;; advised, though, that this comes at the expense of losing the processes'
;; *Async Shell Command* buffer and its log of STDOUT / STDERR for the
;; processes. The former, non-persistent behavior can be opted for at
;; run-time by prefixing the command with a SPACE (eg. " foo") or for the
;; default command simply enter just a SPACE. The former, non-persistent
;; behavior can be made default by modifying variable
;; `diredc-async-processes-are-persistent'.
;;
;; Pressing RETURN on files that you don't want opened in Emacs,
;; doesn't. Pre-existing 'dired' variable
;; 'dired-guess-shell-alist-user' is used as reference, and pressing
;; RETURN runs on the selected file the first associated executable in
;; that list. If you really do want to find the find in Emacs, press
;; C-u RETURN instead.
;;
;; The display format of `dired' buffers can be "hot-swapped" using 'M-t'
;; (M-x `diredc-display-toggle'). Use 'C-u M't' to select from available
;; display formats, and customize the list using defcustom variable
;; `diredc-display--listing-switches-list'. Four views are provided by
;; default, all long-format but with different file block-sizes (byte, Kb,
;; Mb), and several other differences.
;;
;; The traditional `dired' sort feature has been greatly enhanced with a
;; clearer UI and many more sorting options.
;;
;; The `diredc' buffers themselves can also be "hot-swapped", using 'M-u'
;; (M-x `diredc-swap-windows').
;;
;; While emacs does have a native defcustom variable
;; `delete-by-moving-to-trash' to control whether to "really" delete files,
;; `diredc' allows one or more trashed items to be restored, allows the
;; trash to be emptied, and conveniently present trash statistics. Here are
;; the relevant commands and their default keybindings. See each's
;; docstring for more details:
;;
;;     C-<delete> SPC           `diredc-trash-toggle'
;;     C-<delete> <insertchar>  `diredc-trash-toggle'
;;
;;     C-<delete> i             `diredc-trash-info'
;;
;;     C-<delete> j             `diredc-trash-view'
;;     C-<delete> v             `diredc-trash-view'
;;
;;     C-<delete> C-<delete>    `diredc-trash-empty'
;;     C-<delete> x             `diredc-trash-empty'
;;
;;     C-<delete> r             `diredc-trash-restore'
;;
;;     C-k                      `diredc-trash-quick-delete'
;;
;;     C-<delete> ?             `diredc-trash-key-assist'
;;
;; A limitation in `dired' is its inability to natively present a file's
;; supplemental information, such as its possible extended access control
;; list or extended file attributes. `diredc' allows this and more to be
;; presented in the minibuffer echo area as you navigate a `diredc' buffer.
;; Use M-x `diredc-show-more-file-info' to toggle through the default
;; possibilities, or customize the `diredc-show-more-file-info-list' to
;; present the metadata of your choice.
;;
;;     C-c ?     `diredc-show-more-file-info'
;;
;; `diredc' brings bookmarks to dired:
;;
;;     C-c + a   `diredc-bookmark-add'
;;     C-c + j   `diredc-bookmark-jump'
;;     C-c + e   `diredc-bookmark-edit'
;;
;; Emacs has a nifty mode to "edit" a `dired' buffer, bringing the power of
;; emacs to the application of renaming files. `diredc' just gives you the
;; little bit of extra help with convenient keybindings `E' and `e' to
;; enter the mode. If you're happy with your edits, you apply them and exit
;; the mode with `C-c C-c', or abort your editing session with `C-c C-k'.
;;
;; The `diredc-shell' command opens up any type of emacs shell or terminal
;; emulator window and pre-seeds it with useful `dired' values (see section
;; 'Extra Features', below).
;;
;;     '         `diredc-shell'
;;     C-c !     `diredc-shell'
;;     C-c C-k   `diredc-shell-kill'
;;
;; For further information, KRTM, the package's docstrings and the
;; package's defcustom group.

;;
;;; Configuration
;;
;; You can browse and edit this mode's list of `defcustom's using "M-x
;; `customize-group' diredc", but there isn't too much to be found there.
;; Separately, you might want to redefine the default keybindings, but
;; otherwise there is nothing really important about `diredc' itself to
;; configure.
;;
;; `dired' mode itself, however, is a complex and highly configurable
;; package that has been under development for over 25 years. That's a long
;; time for options to accumulate and for opinions to multiply. The
;; `diredc' developer (ahem: me) has considerately imposed his preferences
;; upon you by default, in a way trivial to over-ride. If you don't want
;; them, toggle the value of defcustom `diredc-bonus-configuration' to nil,
;; an the settings will revert upon selecting new buffers. The bonus
;; customization features are listed above, in the 'Commentary' section, or
;; you could peek at the source code of function
;; `diredc-bonus-configuration'.
;;
;; The colorization for each buffer's selected line is set as part of
;; `diredc-bonus-configuration', but because it's controlled by
;; `hl-line-mode'; you can independently toggle the feature per-buffer, and
;; you can change the highlighting colors using "M-x `customize-face'" for
;; faces `hl-line' and `diredc-hl-current-buffer'. The colorization of the
;; chmod bits are also set as part of `diredc-bonus-configuration'; you can
;; find their definitions and edit them using "M-x `customize-group'
;; diredc".

;;
;;; Extra Features:
;;
;; *] Navigating to a parent directory with `dired-up-directory' (default:
;;    `^') can use the prefix-argument to navigate multiple levels in one
;;    operation.
;;
;; *] Use `dired-hist-change-directory' (default: `/') to jump to a
;;    location not nearby without losing the current dired buffer's
;;    history.
;;
;; *] Use the `prefix-argument' with `diredc-hist-change-directory' to have
;;    `diredc-hist-select' display all elements of the Dired buffer's
;;    history and allow you to jump directly to any of them.
;;
;; *] Use `diredc-hist-duplicate' (default: `=') to either navigate to
;;    another `dired' buffer to your current one's directory, or with the
;;    `prefix-argument' to navigate your current `dired' buffer to
;;    another's directory.
;;
;; *] Modify data structure `diredc-recover-schemes' to apply your own
;;    custom recovery strategies. Share them for others' benefit!
;;
;; *) Use `diredc-trash-quick-delete' (default: `C-k') on a POINT or a
;;    REGION to quick-delete the selected files. Use the prefix-arg to
;;    toggle between "trashing" or deleting.
;;
;; *] When `diredc-hist-mode' is disabled, the following functions continue
;;    to operate, but without updating the history records, so you can use
;;    them as your default `dired' functions even if you don't always want
;;    to use `diredc-hist-mode'.
;;
;;      `diredc-hist-change-directory'
;;      `diredc-hist-up-directory'
;;      `diredc-hist-duplicate'
;;      `diredc-hist-find-file'
;;      `diredc-hist-find-file-other-window'
;;      `diredc-hist-find-alternate-file'
;;
;; *] `diredc' passes to the shell/terminal-emulator instance the following
;;    shell variables:
;;
;;      $d1 - this `diredc' windows's directory name
;;      $d2 - directory name of other visible `diredc' window
;;      $f1 - this `diredc' window's file name at POINT
;;      $f2 - file name at POINT  of other visible `diredc' window
;;      $t1 - this `diredc' window's list of tagged file names
;;      $t2 - list of tagged file names  of other visible `diredc' window
;;
;;    If the selected shell supports array variables, then $t1 and $t2 will
;;    be set as such; Otherwise, elements will be quoted and delimited with
;;    a space.

;; *) universal fallback guess shell command(s)

;;
;;; Feedback:
;;
;; It's best to contact me by opening an 'issue' on the program's github
;; repository (see above) or, distant second-best, by direct e-mail.
;;
;; Code contributions are welcome and github starring is appreciated.
;;

;;
;;; Compatibility
;;
;; This package has been tested under debian linux emacs version 26
;; and 27. The main compatibility issue to be aware of is that this
;; suite needs to modify[1] a single line in function
;; `dired-internal-no-select' of the standard emacs file `dired.el'
;; This was accomplished by advising a wrapper function
;; `diredc--advice--dired-internal-noselect' around the original. If
;; that function ever changes, that advice function and this suite
;; will need to account for that.

_OLDFUN is function `dired-repeat-over-lines', which is never

Ref: http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=48883

The advised function was: 1) operating on directory heading
lines; 2) operating on the lines for the \"not-real\" files '.'
and ',,', and; 3) advancing POINT undesirablly. I submitted two
solutions there. Here in `diredc', in order to limit advising the
underlying Emacs package, I'm using the version that alters just
function `dired-repeat-over-lines'. A second version submitted
there applies the fix by changing also function
`dired-between-two-lines'."

respects that of the dired listing, and; 4) the result is posted

Interactively, prompts the user for METHOD, offering the choices
of the CARs of variable `diredc--sort-options' (see there).
Programmatically, if arguments are not provided, defaults to sort
by name, ascending.

Note that the sorting options for chmod, owner, and group are
fragile in the sense that they expect the `diredc' buffer to be
presenting its first four fields in classic \"ls -l\" format.

With a prefix argument, allows the user to manually edit the
current listing switches instead. See variable
`dired-listing-switches', and compare with function
`dired-sort-toggle-or-edit'.

Some of the available sort methods change the environment
variable LC_COLLATE, which you might want set differently for
your Emacs use outside of `diredc'. If you find yourself in such
a situation, evaluating function `diredc-reset-collation' will
restore the variable to how it was found. This will be performed
automatically for you upon exiting `diredc', and you can of
course at any time manually play with function `setenv'.

This function modifies the mode line to reflect the sort order.
You can customize the sort-direction indications. See variables
`diredc-sort-prefix-ascending', `diredc-sort-suffix-ascending',
`diredc-sort-prefix-descending', and

(provide 'diredc)

;;; diredc.el ends here

;;
;;; Integration Notes
;;
;; Should the emacs project incorporate this code, it should consider:
;;
;; *) emacs bug report #44023:
;;    https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=44023
;;
;; *) Function `dired-file-name-at-point' should have an optional
;;    argument NOERROR added, to return NIL instead of signaling
;;    error conditions, and should guarantee a NON-NIL return value
;;    otherwise. Once this is done, then all occurrences of
;;    (diredc--file-name-at-point) should be removed and replaced with
;;    (dired-file-name-at-point 'noerror).
;;
;; *) Defcustoms should include  :version "28.1"
