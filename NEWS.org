* diredc NEWS
** 2024-04

+ New feature to view that single file at the bottom of a "sparse" path, ie.
  /path/with/only/single/entry.

  + diredc-collapse-mode

+ New feature to browse image files

  + diredc-browse-include-images

+ New feature to fontify filenames based upon their names.

  + diredc-fontify-by-file-name
  + diredc-face-file-name-alist

+ New feature to fontify filenames based upon their extensions.

  + diredc-fontify-by-file-extension
  + diredc-face-file-ext-alist

+ New features to fontify 'executable' suffix symbols.

  + diredc-fontify-executable-symbol

+ New feature to immediately apply font-lock configuration changes.

  + diredc-improve-font-lock-performance

+ New user hint messages upon opening 'diredc' shells.

+ Re-organize customization options into sub-groups.

+ New feature to improve dired's buffer updating

  This fixes dired's failure to update upon the change of a size of
  file listed in the buffer. For example, creating a tar archive would
  always cause the archive file to display as size 0.

  + diredc-update-interval

+ Improvement to 'diredc-exit' cleanup.

** 2024-03

+ New environment variable $INSIDE_DIREDC for shell windows.

** 2024-01

+ New feature for key-presses RETURN and C-u RETURN.

  + For file-types associated with shell commands in variable
    'dired-guess-shell-alist-user', pressing RETURN on that file runs
    the first of those shell commands, asynchronously. To 'find' that
    file in Emacs, use C-u RETURN.

+ New feature: customizable parameters for the diredc frame.

  + See new defcustom variables 'diredc-frame-parameters' and
    'diredc-frame-inherited-parameters'.

+ Modification: Display of file information

  + Add long description of what is being displayed.

  + Add current position in list of display options (ie. [n/m]).

  + Fontify output.

** 2022-01

+ New feature to fontify diredc-browse buffers

** 2021-06

+ New feature to add a header line to diredc buffers.

  + When entries are either marked or flagged for deletion, the header
    line displays a tally of the number of files, directories, and
    links marked / flagged, and the size of the files.

+ Improvements to toggling window dedication and diredc features when
  disabling and re-enabling M-x diredc-mode.

+ Allow asynchronous shell commands to over-ride shell aliases (ie.
  don't interpret a leading '\' as part of a command name for
  validation purposes).

** 2021-05

+ New feature to add many sorting options to diredc buffers.

  + All "ls" sort options, plus LC_COLLATE modification, plus sorting
    by chmod, owner, or group.

  + Improve UI for ease-of-use.

+ New feature to fontify the current line of the current diredc buffer
  independently of the selected line of the 'other' diredc buffer.

  + Ref: face diredc-hl-current-buffer

+ New feature to hot-swap dired buffers, bound by default to "M-u"

  + Inspired by midnight commander's "C-u", but performs a true and
    complete swap, including buffer histories. Operates also on
    diredc-browse buffers.

** 2021-04

+ Asynchronous processes by default survive even after exiting Emacs.

  + See defcustom 'diredc-async-processes-are-persistent' and
    discussion in README

+ New help functions bound by default to "?", "? h", and "C-DEL ?"

  + Required installation of external package 'key-assist' (MELPA, Github)

+ The state of 'dired-omit-mode' is remembered when navigating.

** 2021-03

+ Quick-browse mode can be configured to exclude files by their
  extensions, coding-systems, or mime-type.

  + See defcustoms: 'diredc-browse-exclude-file-extensions' and
    'diredc-browse-exclude-coding-systems'
