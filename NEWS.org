** 2021-05

+ New feature to fontify the current line of the current diredc buffer
  independently of the selected line of the 'other' diredc buffer.

  + Ref: face diredc-hl-current-buffer

+ New feature to hot-swap dired buffers, bound by default to "M-u"

  + Inspired by midnight commander's "C-u", but performs a true and
    complete swap, including buffer histories. Operates also on
    diredc-browse buffers.

** 2021-04

+ Asynchronous processes by default survive even after exiting Emacs.

  + See defcustom 'diredc-async-processes-are-persistent' and
    discussion in README

+ New help functions bound by default to "?", "? h", and "C-DEL ?"

  + Required installation of external package 'key-assist' (MELPA, Github)

+ The state of 'dired-omit-mode' is remembered when navigating.

** 2021-03

+ Quick-browse mode can be configured to exclude files by their
  extensions, coding-systems, or mime-type.

  + See defcustoms: 'diredc-browse-exclude-file-extensions' and
    'diredc-browse-exclude-coding-systems'
